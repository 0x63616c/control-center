# Central Env/Config Registry — Design Spec

Date: 2026-07-23
Status: Design (no code yet)
Fixes: import-order config bug hotfixed in `3db4dde87` (bare `import "./env"`
pinned atop `apps/api/src/server.ts`). This design makes that hotfix
unnecessary.

---

## 1. The bug this fixes

16 feature `config.ts` files each run `z.object({...}).parse(process.env)` at
**module-eval time**. `apps/api/src/server.ts` imported feature modules
(`@features/ac/service`, `@features/booth/service`, …) via its import graph
*before* `./env` ran its `hydrateSecretFiles()` side effect. Those features
therefore parsed an **un-hydrated** `process.env` and baked in schema DEFAULTS:
empty `HA_TOKEN`, localhost `DATABASE_URL`. In prod this produced silent-wrong
behavior — climate/wakes/booth/tv tiles 500ed against real `/run/secrets`
because the feature's own HA client and DB pool had frozen the placeholder
values at import.

The values that broke were **valid-but-wrong defaults**: `""` and
`postgresql://cc:cc@localhost:5432/controlcenter` pass Zod validation, pass CI
green, and only fail against the real secret mount in prod.

### Root defect (three compounding faults)

1. **Import-time reads of mutable global state.** Config parses `process.env`
   at import, when that state is hydrated *late* (after the secret files are
   read into `process.env`). Any import-order change re-breaks it.
2. **Decentralized re-declaration.** 16 schemas hand-copy shared keys
   (`DATABASE_URL` appears in 11 configs, `HA_URL`/`HA_TOKEN` in 5, the
   `UNIFI_*` trio in 2, `HOME_*` in 2) each with its own hand-synced default
   comment ("copied verbatim from apps/api/src/env.ts to stay in lockstep").
3. **Silent-wrong defaults.** A missing prod secret falls back to a default
   that *looks* configured, so the failure surfaces as a runtime 500, never as
   a boot crash.

---

## 2. Goals (all four required)

| # | Goal | How this design meets it |
|---|------|--------------------------|
| 1 | **Fail-fast on missing secrets** | Prod-required keys are declared `.required()` with **no valid-but-wrong default** (an optional `.devDefault()` covers local dev only). `assertEnv(runtime)` runs at boot, after hydration, and `process.exit(1)` with a structured log listing every missing key when `APP_ENV==="production"`. The bare hydrate-first import (`3db4dde87`) is not deleted — it **evolves** into the sanctioned, validating boot entry (§5.6, §9): same import-time side effect, now registry-owned and fail-fast. |
| 2 | **One place to see all env** | A single `defineEnv({...})` manifest in `packages/platform/env/registry.ts` declares every key once — name, type, requiredness, owning runtime(s), owning feature. Answers "what does prod need" in one file and cross-checks against the existing `secretCatalog` (§7), feeding the deferred `vault.yaml` cleanup. |
| 3 | **Order-independent (lazy)** | Config values are read from the hydrated `process.env` on **first property access**, memoized thereafter — never eagerly at parse time. This removes the *freeze-at-parse* fault: a config module can be imported before hydration without baking in a default. **One narrow ordering requirement remains and is met by construction, not by laziness alone**: feature `deps.ts`/`db.ts`/`service.ts` modules construct pools and HA clients at *module top* (e.g. `features/ac/deps.ts:22-27`, every `features/*/db.ts`, `apps/api/src/db/index.ts:7`), so the *first access* to a lazy config value happens during the static-import phase, before any executable boot statement runs. Hydration must therefore precede feature imports. That is guaranteed by a **Biome-pinned side-effect boot import** at the very top of each entrypoint (§5.6, §9) — the same mechanism the hotfix used, now registry-owned. Laziness narrows the requirement from "`env` before every feature's `parse()`" to "boot import before feature imports"; it does **not** eliminate it, because module-top construction touches config at import. Proven by a regression test that imports a config *before* hydration and asserts a later access still reads the hydrated value (§8.1). |
| 4 | **No duplicated defaults** | Each key — shared or feature-owned — is declared exactly once in the registry. Feature configs become typed *projections* (`ENV.pick(...)`), never re-declarations. |

---

## 3. Layering decision

Current facts (verified):

- `packages/platform` has **zero runtime dependencies** (only devDeps). It is
  the lowest shared-substrate layer.
- `packages/core` depends on `@www/logger`, `@www/worker-runtime`, `drizzle`,
  `pg`. Neither `platform` nor `core` imports the other today.
- `hydrateSecretFiles()` (`packages/core/src/secrets/hydrate.ts`) and
  `databaseUrlFromSecret()` (`packages/core/src/db/pool.ts`) are called **only**
  by `apps/api/src/env.ts`. `createPool()` (also in `pool.ts`) is called by
  `core` itself and by several feature `db.ts` files.
- Features already import `@www/core` and `@www/logger` as workspace packages,
  so they can import `@www/platform` the same way (no packaging change needed).
- Biome's dependency-boundary rule (`biome.json` override ~215) bans
  `platform` + `core` from importing `app-kit`/`features`; it says nothing about
  `platform ↔ core`.

**Decision: the registry lives in `packages/platform/env/` and platform owns
hydration end-to-end.** `hydrateSecretFiles()` and `databaseUrlFromSecret()`
**move into `packages/platform/env/hydrate.ts`**. `packages/core/src/db/pool.ts`
keeps only `createPool()` (a pure `connectionString → Pool` factory with no env
read). Nothing in `core` calls `databaseUrlFromSecret()`, so this move creates
**no** `platform → core` edge and inverts no layer. Platform stays
dependency-light and becomes the single owner of env: declaration + hydration +
validation + access.

Rejected alternative: keep hydration in `core` and have `platform/env` import
`@www/core`. This adds a heavy `platform → core` runtime edge (pulling logger,
worker-runtime, drizzle, pg into the base layer) and inverts the intuitive
layering. Worse on every axis.

One dependency the registry *does* take: `@www/logger` (for the fail-fast log
line). `platform → logger` is a clean downward edge (`logger` imports nothing of
ours), matching `core → logger`. Add `@www/logger` to `packages/platform`
`dependencies`.

## 4. Complete env-key inventory

Requiredness tiers used below:

- **required** — must be present in prod. `assertEnv("production")` crashes if
  missing. No prod default. May carry a `devDefault` used only when
  `APP_ENV!=="production"` (keeps local dev booting without leaking a real
  value into the repo).
- **optional-secret** — a secret with **no default**; resolves to `undefined`
  at *runtime* when absent (not `""`). Its **static type stays `string`**, not
  `string | undefined` (decision below). The owning feature's `isConfigured()` /
  `isApnsConfigured()` gate no-ops the feature before any use, so the value is
  only ever read when actually present. Honest replacement for today's
  `.default("")`, and typecheck-compatible with it.

  **Static-type decision (resolves the `string | undefined` typecheck break).**
  `optionalSecret()` deliberately declares its static type as **`string`** while
  returning `undefined` at runtime when unset. Rationale: today these keys are
  `.default("")`, so every consumer already sees `string` and passes the value
  straight into `string` params —
  `signApnsJwt(config.APNS_KEY_ID, config.APNS_TEAM_ID, config.APNS_KEY_CONTENT)`
  (`features/notif/apns.ts:205`; `signApnsJwt(keyId: string, teamId: string,
  p8Pem: string)` at `apns.ts:68`),
  `signAscJwt(env.ASC_KEY_ID, env.ASC_ISSUER_ID, env.ASC_KEY_CONTENT)`
  (`apps/api/src/services/asc-version-service.ts:133`),
  `features/sound/spotify-service.ts:37-39`, and `features/deploys/service.ts`.
  A `Boolean(...)` gate (`isConfigured()`/`isApnsConfigured()`) does **not**
  narrow `string | undefined` to `string` for TypeScript, so widening the type
  would turn every one of those call sites into a
  "`string | undefined` not assignable to `string`" error, breaking the
  independent greenness of Steps 6-8 (which rewrite *only* `config.ts`). Keeping
  the static type `string` means the config-migration commits touch **only**
  `config.ts` files — no consumer edits, no re-typing — while runtime behavior
  (undefined when unmounted, feature self-disables via its gate) is exactly the
  design's intent and matches today's degraded-feature contract. The `string`
  type is a documented, gate-guarded convenience (the same shape `.default("")`
  gave), scoped to `optionalSecret()` only; genuinely-nullable public keys use
  `.optional()` (below), which **does** widen to `T | undefined`.
- **default** — safe, public, non-secret default; identical in every env.
- **optional** — may be absent anywhere → `undefined`.

Secret? column marks values that must never be logged (aligned with the logger
redaction list) and that ride the `/run/secrets` docker-secret mount.

The table above lists all 45 env keys touched by this design, but the typed
manifest at `packages/platform/env/manifest.ts` (`defineEnv({...})`) declares
only **42** of them. The gap is the three `logger (carve-out, §6)` /
`logger (carve-out)` rows — `APP_ENV`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_PRETTY` — which are
real env vars read directly via `process.env` in `packages/platform/env/`
(`fields.ts`, `assert.ts`), deliberately kept outside the typed registry per
§6's carve-out mechanism. They exist and behave as documented in the table;
they're just not `defineEnv` keys. 45 table rows − 3 carve-outs = 42 manifest
keys, matching the live file.

### Hydration inputs (not typed registry keys)

`databaseUrlFromSecret()` consumes these to **derive** `DATABASE_URL`; they are
inputs to hydration, not values the app reads through the registry. They stay
inside `packages/platform/env/hydrate.ts` (which retains its `process.env`
carve-out), not the manifest:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` — the mounted secret file (deny-listed from `process.env`
  by `hydrateSecretFiles`, read from its file to build the URL). Required in
  prod *transitively*: if absent, `DATABASE_URL` is undefined and the
  `DATABASE_URL` required-check fires.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE` (default `/run/secrets/POSTGRES_PASSWORD`),
  `POSTGRES_HOST` (`postgres`), `POSTGRES_PORT` (`5432`), `POSTGRES_USER`
  (`postgres`), `POSTGRES_DB` (`control_center`).

### Note on the `required` set vs. the docker-secret mount

The `secretCatalog` in `packages/platform/src/index.ts` mounts ~20 secrets for
both api and worker. Not all are hard-required: `SPOTIFY_*`, `ASC_*`, `APNS_*`,
`GITHUB_ACTIONS_TOKEN` are **optional-secret** — their features self-disable
cleanly (`isConfigured()` / `isApnsConfigured()` gates), so a missing mount is a
degraded feature, not a broken app, even in prod. The **required** set is the
narrow group whose absence in prod is either a hard failure or a silent-wrong
default that the bug exploited: `DATABASE_URL`, `HA_TOKEN`, `UNIFI_API_KEY`,
`WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, `WIFI_GUEST_SSID`, `HOME_LAT`, `HOME_LON`. These
get the fail-fast boot check.

---

## 5. Components & interfaces

All under `packages/platform/env/`, exported from a new subpath
`@www/platform/env` (add to `packages/platform/package.json` `exports`).

### 5.1 Field builders (`fields.ts`)

Thin wrappers over Zod that carry registry metadata. Each returns a
`FieldSpec<T>`:

```
str()      → string
url()      → string, validated as URL
pgUrl()    → string, validated as postgres URL
num()      → number (coerced)
int()      → integer (coerced)
bool()     → boolean ("true"/"1" → true)
secret()   → string, flagged secret:true (never logged; feeds redaction audit)
enumOf(a,b,c) → union
```

Chainable on every builder:

```
.required()        // must exist in prod; assertEnv enforces; no prod default
.default(v)        // optional; same value every env
.devDefault(v)     // fallback ONLY when APP_ENV!=="production"; still prod-required
.optional()        // may be absent anywhere → undefined
.forRuntime(...r)  // "api" | "worker" | "web" | "all"  (default "all")
.forFeature(id)    // owning feature id, documentation + query grouping
```

`FieldSpec` shape (internal): `{ parse(raw): T, required: boolean,
runtimes: Runtime[], feature?: string, secret: boolean, hasDefault: boolean,
devDefault?: T, prodDefault?: T }`.

### 5.2 The manifest (`registry.ts`)

```
export const ENV = defineEnv({
  DATABASE_URL: pgUrl().required().devDefault("postgresql://cc:cc@localhost:5432/controlcenter"),
  HA_URL: url().default("http://homeassistant.local:8123"),
  HA_TOKEN: secret().required().forFeature("ac"),
  CLIMATE_ENTITY_ID: str().default("climate.home").forRuntime("api").forFeature("ac"),
  SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID: secret().optionalSecret().forRuntime("api").forFeature("sound"),
  // ... every key from §4, declared exactly once ...
});
```

`defineEnv(spec)` returns a **lazy, memoized, typed accessor** `ENV`.
`typeof ENV` is a mapped type `{ readonly [K in keyof spec]: TypeOf<spec[K]> }`
where an `.optional()` field widens to `T | undefined`, but an
`.optionalSecret()` field stays `string` (runtime-`undefined`, gate-guarded — see
§4 static-type decision). Only `.optional()` widens; `.optionalSecret()` does
not.

### 5.3 Lazy access mechanism — **Proxy** (decision)

`ENV` is a `Proxy` over an empty target with a `get` trap:

1. On `ENV.HA_TOKEN`: if the key is cached, return it.
2. Else look up the `FieldSpec`, read `process.env["HA_TOKEN"]` (already
   hydrated), apply parse / default / devDefault / required-missing rules,
   cache the result in a module `Map`, return it.

Chosen over a plain object of `Object.defineProperty` getters because:

- **`pick()` projections need it anyway.** A feature config is
  `ENV.pick("DATABASE_URL","HA_URL","HA_TOKEN")` — an arbitrary subset with
  ergonomic `config.HA_TOKEN` access and correct per-key types. A Proxy with a
  `get` trap that validates the key is in the picked set and delegates to the
  shared cache is the cleanest projection; a getter-object would need to
  re-define getters per projection.
- **O(1) construction, no eager enumeration** — matters under the 10x–100x
  key-count invariant. Nothing is parsed until touched.
- Ergonomic `config.X` (not `config().X`) call sites are preserved — a hard
  requirement to keep the migration mechanical.

The static type is supplied by casting the Proxy to the mapped type; TypeScript
sees a fully-typed object, the runtime is the trap. `has`/`ownKeys` traps are
implemented so `"KEY" in ENV` and enumeration work for tooling.

A single module-level `Map<string, unknown>` backs both `ENV` and every
`pick()` view, so a key parsed once is shared. `__resetEnvCache()` (test-only,
underscore-prefixed) clears it between test cases.

### 5.4 `pick()`

```
pick<K extends keyof Spec>(...keys: K[]): { readonly [P in K]: TypeOf<Spec[P]> }
```

Returns a Proxy whose `get` trap throws if the accessed key is not in `keys`
(so a feature can't silently reach a key it didn't declare), else delegates to
the shared cache. This is what every feature `config.ts` becomes:

```
// features/ac/config.ts
import { ENV } from "@www/platform/env";
export const config = ENV.pick("DATABASE_URL", "HA_URL", "HA_TOKEN", "CLIMATE_ENTITY_ID", "TESLA_ENTITY_PREFIX");
```

No Zod, no `process.env`, no duplicated defaults, no import-time parse.

### 5.5 `assertEnv(runtime)` — the fail-fast guard

```
assertEnv(runtime: "api" | "worker"): void
```

- No-op unless `process.env.APP_ENV === "production"` (read live — never the
  bundle-baked `NODE_ENV`, per the logger's `www-rw07` lesson). Dev/test boot
  unchanged.
- Iterates every `FieldSpec` where `required === true` and the runtime is in
  `runtimes` (or `runtimes` includes `"all"`).
- Collects keys whose hydrated `process.env` value is absent or empty.
- If the missing list is non-empty: log a structured fatal
  `{ missingKeys, runtime }, "required env missing — refusing to boot"` then
  `process.exit(1)`. Loud, structured, lists every missing key at once (not
  one-at-a-time).
- **Logger sourcing (must not use `getLogger()`).** `assertEnv` runs from the
  side-effect boot import (§5.6), which executes during the static-import phase —
  **before** the entrypoint's own `createLogger({ service: "api" })` call runs
  (`apps/api/src/server.ts:26`). `getLogger()` throws if the root logger is not
  yet registered (`packages/logger/src/index.ts:157-160`), which would mask the
  `{missingKeys}` diagnostic behind an opaque "getLogger() called before
  createLogger()" error — defeating Goal 1. Therefore `assertEnv` builds its
  **own** logger with `createLogger({ service: "env" })` for the fatal line
  rather than calling `getLogger()`. This is safe: `createLogger` sets the
  process `_root`, and the entrypoint's later `createLogger({ service: "api" })`
  simply re-registers it — but in the fail path the process `exit(1)`s
  immediately, so the transient root is never observed. The env logger inherits
  the same redaction paths, so no secret leaks. (`initEnv` sequencing cannot be
  reordered after `createLogger` instead, because issue-1's fix requires
  hydration to run as a side-effect import *before* feature imports, which run
  before any executable `createLogger` statement — §5.6.)
- Also validates that present required keys *parse* (e.g. `DATABASE_URL` is a
  valid pg URL), surfacing a malformed secret as a boot crash too.

### 5.6 `initEnv(runtime)` — the boot entry, invoked as a side-effect import

```
initEnv(runtime: "api" | "worker"): void
```

Does, in order:

1. `hydrateSecretFiles()` — read `/run/secrets/*` into `process.env`.
2. `const url = databaseUrlFromSecret(); if (url) process.env.DATABASE_URL = url;`
3. `assertEnv(runtime)`.

**It must run before feature imports, so it is invoked from a side-effect module
that each entrypoint imports FIRST — never as an executable statement.** This is
the crux of issue-1's resolution. Feature `deps.ts`/`db.ts`/`service.ts` modules
construct pools and HA clients at module top (`features/ac/deps.ts:22-27`, every
`features/*/db.ts`, `apps/api/src/db/index.ts:7`, `features/dogcam/service.ts`),
so they perform the *first lazy access* to `config.DATABASE_URL`/`config.HA_TOKEN`
during the static-import phase. An executable `initEnv("api")` "first statement"
runs *after* all static imports resolve — i.e. after those module-top accesses
have already memoized the pre-hydration values. That would reintroduce the exact
`3db4dde87` prod bug (climate/tv/dogcam/booth 500 on empty `HA_TOKEN` / localhost
`DATABASE_URL`). Laziness does not save us here because first access *is* at
import time.

**Mechanism — a thin per-app side-effect boot module** whose body calls
`initEnv` at module-eval, imported as the pinned first line of each entrypoint
(before any `@features/*` import):

```
// apps/api/src/boot-env.ts
import { initEnv } from "@www/platform/env";
initEnv("api"); // runs at import: hydrate -> derive DATABASE_URL -> assertEnv
```
```
// apps/api/src/server.ts (Biome-pinned first import)
import "./boot-env";              // MUST precede every @features/* import
import { GENERATED_ROUTES } from "@features/_generated/http.gen";
// ...
```

The worker gets `apps/worker/src/boot-env.ts` calling `initEnv("worker")`, pinned
first in `apps/worker/src/index.ts`. (A single per-app module is used rather than
a shared `@www/platform/env/boot` subpath because the runtime arg — `"api"` vs
`"worker"` — must be baked into the side-effect; two exported boot subpaths would
work equally but per-app modules keep the arg local and obvious.)

After the boot import runs, `process.env` is fully hydrated and validated, so
every subsequent lazy `config.X` read — including the module-top ones in the very
next feature import — is correct. Import order can still break correctness **iff**
the boot import is not first. It is pinned by the **same mechanism that pinned the
hotfix**: Biome's `organizeImports` (`biome.json:6`) treats a bare side-effect
import as a sort barrier and never reorders named imports above it, so once the
boot import is written first it stays first (§6). This is the precise, narrowed
ordering guarantee — not "order-independent in all cases", which is false while
construction happens at import.

### 5.7 `hydrate.ts`

`hydrateSecretFiles()` and `databaseUrlFromSecret()` move here verbatim from
`packages/core`. Behavior unchanged (listless `/run/secrets` hydration,
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` deny-list, explicit-env-wins). This file keeps a
`process.env` Biome carve-out (it is the hydration boundary).

---

## 6. Biome enforcement

`noProcessEnv` is **already a global `style` rule at `error`** (biome.json:45).
The ban exists; this work adjusts its scope. Two carve-out mechanisms are
already in use and both are kept:

- **Override blocks** (biome.json `overrides`): api/env.ts, drizzle.config,
  vite.config, e2e-portal, scripts, `packages/logger/src`, infra/unifi, core
  pg-contract tests, `packages/core/src/db/pool.ts` + `secrets/hydrate.ts`, and
  `features/**/config.ts`.
- **Inline `// biome-ignore lint/style/noProcessEnv`** — capacitor.config.ts,
  infra/src/vault.ts.

Changes for this work:

1. **Add** an override turning `noProcessEnv` off for
   `packages/platform/env/**` — the ONE sanctioned place that reads
   `process.env` (registry + hydration).
2. **Remove** the `features/**/config.ts` override (biome.json ~153-162) once
   all 16 features are migrated. After migration no feature config reads
   `process.env`; deleting the carve-out makes a regression *unshippable* — a
   new feature that reaches for `process.env` fails lint. This is the
   enforcement teeth, mirroring the sound-bus `AudioContext` ban.
3. **Update** the existing `packages/core/src/db/pool.ts` +
   `secrets/hydrate.ts` override: `hydrate.ts` moves to platform (covered by
   #1); `pool.ts` no longer reads `process.env` once `databaseUrlFromSecret`
   moves out, so drop `pool.ts` from the carve-out (or leave it harmless — the
   plan removes it for cleanliness).

**Boot-import ordering (not a `noProcessEnv` change).** The pinned side-effect
boot import (§5.6) relies on `organizeImports` (`biome.json:6`) keeping a bare
side-effect import as a leading sort barrier — the identical mechanism that held
the `import "./env"` hotfix at the top. No new lint rule is needed; the migration
simply repoints that first side-effect import from `./env` to `./boot-env`. The
pinned-first invariant is therefore preserved across the migration, not
re-derived.

**Legitimate lower-layer / build-time carve-outs that stay:**

- `packages/logger/src/**` — the logger is the lowest layer and deliberately
  reads `APP_ENV`/`LOG_LEVEL`/`LOG_PRETTY` live (it cannot depend on the
  registry; the registry depends on *it*). `APP_ENV`/`LOG_*` are listed in the
  manifest §4 as documentation only; the logger keeps reading them directly.
- `apps/api/drizzle.config.ts`, `apps/web/vite.config.ts`,
  `apps/web/capacitor.config.ts`, `apps/web/e2e-portal/playwright.config.ts` —
  build-time / tooling configs that run outside the app runtime.
- `scripts/**`, `infra/**` (unifi override + inline ignores in vault.ts) —
  Pulumi / one-shot tooling, not the app runtime.

---

## 7. Relationship to `secretCatalog` (goal 2 payoff)

`packages/platform/src/index.ts` already declares `secretCatalog` +
`controlCenterServiceSecretUsages()` — the **infra** view of which secrets each
service's `/run/secrets` mount receives, keyed to SOPS vault keys. The registry
is the **runtime** view of the same secrets plus all the non-secret config.

They must not drift. Because both now live in `packages/platform`, a small
consistency test can assert: every registry key tagged `secret` + `required`
(or `optional-secret`) has a matching `secretCatalog` entry, and vice versa.
This is the single source of truth that feeds the deferred `vault.yaml`
secrets-cleanup (memory: `secrets-cleanup-after-track-c`). The test is
**recommended, not required** for this work — noted as a follow-up so the two
manifests are provably in sync.

When written, the parity test should also pin a **known `secretCatalog` oddity**
so the registry does not silently inherit it: `secretCatalog`
(`packages/platform/src/index.ts:347-348`) maps `WIFI_SSID → wifiMain.ssid` but
`WIFI_PASSWORD → wifiGuest.password` (the password comes from the *guest* SOPS
key, not the main one). The registry declares both as `secret().required()`
(§4); the parity assertion should assert this exact catalog↔vault mapping so a
future edit can't drift the two apart unnoticed. (Verified fact: api and worker
declare the identical secret set — `packages/platform/src/index.ts:336-374` — so
`assertEnv("worker")` requiring `DATABASE_URL/HA_TOKEN/HOME_LAT/HOME_LON` is
satisfied by the worker's prod mount; the §4 required-set assumption holds for
both runtimes.)

---

## 8. Testing

`packages/platform/test/env.test.ts` (vitest, matching platform's existing test
layout):

1. **Order-independence regression (the headline test, TDD-first, must fail
   before the lazy Proxy exists).**
   - Arrange: ensure `process.env.HA_TOKEN` is unset/empty.
   - Import a config that picks `HA_TOKEN` (or `ENV` directly). Assert the
     import itself does **not** throw and does **not** freeze a value.
   - Set `process.env.HA_TOKEN = "real-token-xyz"` (simulating late
     hydration).
   - Access `config.HA_TOKEN`. Assert `=== "real-token-xyz"`.
   - This reproduces the exact bug: module imported before hydration, value
     still correct. Against today's eager `parse(process.env)` it would return
     `""`.
2. **Field builders**: each of str/url/pgUrl/num/int/bool/secret parses and
   rejects correctly; `.default`/`.devDefault`/`.required`/`.optional`
   semantics.
3. **Memoization**: second access returns cached value; `__resetEnvCache()`
   forces a re-read.
4. **`pick()` isolation**: accessing a key not in the picked set throws;
   accessing a picked key returns the shared cached value.
5. **`assertEnv` fail-fast**: with `APP_ENV="production"` and a required key
   absent, `assertEnv("api")` calls `process.exit` (spied) and logs the missing
   key. With the key present it is a no-op. With `APP_ENV` unset (dev), missing
   required keys do **not** exit.
6. **`assertEnv` parse failure**: a present-but-malformed `DATABASE_URL` in prod
   mode fails the boot check.
7. **`devDefault` gating**: `HOME_LAT` unset + `APP_ENV!=="production"` →
   `34.0537`; unset + `APP_ENV="production"` → `assertEnv` exits (no silent LA
   City Hall in prod).
8. **secretCatalog parity** (recommended follow-up, §7).

Existing suites and how they change (plan Steps 4/9/10):

- `apps/api/src/__tests__/env.test.ts` — **rewritten/deleted**: it asserts the
  old `""`/localhost defaults (`env.HA_TOKEN).toBe("")`, `env.SPOTIFY_*.toBe("")`,
  `DATABASE_URL).toBe("postgresql://cc:cc@localhost…")`) that this design
  intentionally reverses, and imports an `envSchema` the registry does not export.
  Equivalent coverage lives in `packages/platform/test/env.test.ts`.
- `apps/api/src/__tests__/guest-server.test.ts` and `worker-deps.test.ts` — drop
  their `envSchema.parse({})` usage (plan Step 10).
- `apps/api/src/__tests__/asc-version-service.test.ts` +
  `youtube-ingest-service.test.ts` — retarget `vi.mock("../env")` to
  `vi.mock("@www/platform/env")` (plan Step 10). Feature `vi.mock("./config")`
  mocks are unaffected (they replace the whole module, so the read-only `pick()`
  Proxy is never exercised).
- `packages/core` hydrate/pool tests — the cases covering the *moved* symbols
  (`databaseUrlFromSecret`, `hydrateSecretFiles`) **move to
  `packages/platform/test/`** so no `core` test imports `@www/platform` (plan
  Step 4); `createPool`-only cases stay in `packages/core`.
- Every feature's own tests, and `apps:check` codegen (imports the branded facets
  — must not throw at import, which the lazy config guarantees even more strongly
  than today) — stay green unchanged.

## 9. Fail-fast behavior summary

| Situation | Today | After |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Prod, `HA_TOKEN` secret unmounted | features bake `""`, tiles 500 per-request | `assertEnv("api")` logs `{missingKeys:["HA_TOKEN"]}` + `exit(1)` at boot; deploy crash-loops visibly instead of serving broken tiles |
| Prod, `DATABASE_URL` underivable (no `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` mount) | localhost default → connection errors | boot crash listing `DATABASE_URL` |
| Dev, no secrets mounted | works via defaults | works via `devDefault` / defaults; `assertEnv` no-op (`APP_ENV!=="production"`) |
| Feature imported before hydration, boot import first (the required order) | value frozen to default (the bug) | value read lazily post-hydration; correct |
| Feature imported before the boot import (boot import not first) | N/A (hotfix forced order) | still wrong — module-top pool/client memoizes pre-hydration value; **this is why the boot import stays pinned first (§5.6) and is not "retired" into an executable statement** |
| New feature reaches for `process.env` | allowed (carve-out) | Biome lint error (carve-out removed) |

## 10. Migration approach

Incremental, each slice independently committable + verifiable (see the plan
doc). Order: scaffold registry + fields + tests (regression test RED first) →
lazy Proxy + pick + memoization (regression GREEN) → move hydration into
platform + `assertEnv`/`initEnv` → populate the full manifest → migrate the 16
feature configs in batches (grouped by shared-key cluster) → migrate
`apps/api` + `apps/worker` entrypoints and their internal `env` consumers to
`config`, and replace the pinned `import "./env"` with a pinned
`import "./boot-env"` (still a side-effect import; runtime arg baked in) → Biome
scope change (add platform/env carve-out, remove features carve-out) → delete the
now-empty `apps/api/src/env.ts` schema, final verify.

The api hotfix stays in place until the boot module exists and the internal `env`
consumers are migrated; then the bare `import "./env"` is **repointed** to
`import "./boot-env"` (whose body runs `initEnv("api")` at module-eval). The
side-effect-import-first ordering is preserved, not removed — module-top pool/HA
construction in feature `deps.ts`/`db.ts` still reads config during import, so
hydration must still run first. What changes is that the boot import is now
registry-owned and fail-fast (`assertEnv`), and the schema/defaults it carried are
gone. There is **no** version of this that replaces the side-effect import with a
plain executable `initEnv()` statement (that runs after feature imports → the bug
returns).

## 11. Risks

- **Shared checkout / parallel sessions.** ~8–10 sessions push `main`. The
  16-file config migration touches many files; stage explicit paths, never
  `git add -A`, `git show --stat HEAD` after each commit, rebase-autostash
  before each push. Batch feature migrations so each commit is small and
  independently green.
- **`worker` env import path.** The worker imports `env` via
  `@control-center/api/worker` (`worker-deps.ts` re-exports `./env`). After
  migration the worker must call `initEnv("worker")` itself and read
  `config` — verify `worker-deps.ts`'s `export { env }` is repointed or the
  worker imports `@www/platform/env` directly. Missing this re-breaks worker
  hydration order.
- **`env.*` call-site surface (full inventory — larger than server.ts + worker).**
  `apps/api/src/env.ts` is imported by **nine** runtime modules, all of which must
  migrate to `@www/platform/env` `config` **before** `env.ts` is deleted (Step
  10), or root typecheck goes red across them:
  1. `apps/api/src/server.ts:17` — `env.PORT/NODE_ENV/GUEST_*` (+ the pinned
     side-effect import at line 7).
  2. `apps/api/src/worker-deps.ts:21` — `export { env } from "./env"` re-export
     (repoint or drop; see the worker risk below).
  3. `apps/api/src/trpc/routers/health.ts:26` — `env.BUILD_HASH`.
  4. `apps/api/src/integrations/homeassistant/index.ts:12` —
     `env.HA_URL`, `env.HA_TOKEN`.
  5. `apps/api/src/db/index.ts:7` — `env.DATABASE_URL` (module-top
     `createPool` — a first-access-at-import site).
  6. `apps/api/src/services/climate-enforcer-service.ts:138,163` —
     `env.CLIMATE_ENTITY_ID` (worker-runtime service living under apps/api).
  7. `apps/api/src/services/youtube-ingest-service.ts:192` —
     `env.MEDIA_STORAGE_DIR`.
  8. `apps/api/src/services/asc-version-service.ts:56,133,141` —
     `env.ASC_KEY_ID/ASC_ISSUER_ID/ASC_KEY_CONTENT/ASC_APP_ID`.
  9. `apps/api/src/services/weight-service.ts:24` — `env.HA_WEIGHT_ENTITY_ID`.

  Plus the worker entrypoint (`apps/worker/src/index.ts:69,79,170,194`) reading
  `env.YOUTUBE_INGEST_ENABLED/MEDIA_STORAGE_DIR/NODE_ENV`. Several of these are
  worker-runtime services (climate/weight/asc) that happen to live under
  `apps/api` — the registry keys they read (`CLIMATE_ENTITY_ID`,
  `HA_WEIGHT_ENTITY_ID`, `ASC_*`) are tagged to the correct runtime in §4. A
  missed site that still imports the deleted `env` fails typecheck (caught
  pre-push). The plan migrates all nine within Step 9, before the Step 10
  deletion.
- **Proxy vs. static typing.** The `as` cast to the mapped type is the only
  unsound spot; the field-builder tests + a couple of `expectTypeOf` assertions
  pin the inferred types so a wrong builder return can't silently widen.
- **`devDefault` for `HOME_LAT`/`HOME_LON`.** Promoting these to `required()`
  means prod now crashes if the Home Location secret is unmounted (previously it
  silently showed LA City Hall). This is the intended fail-fast, but it is a
  behavior change for any prod deploy currently relying on the placeholder —
  confirm the Home Location secret is mounted in prod before shipping the
  entrypoint wiring (it is, per `secretCatalog.homeLocation` in the api/worker
  mount).
- **`assertEnv` prod-gating correctness.** Relies on `APP_ENV="production"`
  being set in prod (verified: infra/src/services.ts:137-138). If a future
  runtime forgets to set it, `assertEnv` silently no-ops. The secretCatalog
  parity test (§7) is the backstop.
- **Bun `NODE_ENV` inlining.** Never gate registry behavior on `NODE_ENV`
  (bundle-baked). Use live `APP_ENV`. Same trap that crash-looped prod in
  `www-rw07`.
